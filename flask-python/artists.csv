Ridiculed during his lifetime by critics, he came to be recognized as a self-taught genius whose works are of high artistic quality. Rousseau's work exerted an extensive influence on several generations of avant-garde artists.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Rousseau,70
41,Georges Seurat,1859 - 1891,Post-Impressionism,French,"Georges-Pierre Seurat (2 December 1859 - 29 March 1891) was a French post-Impressionist artist. He is best known for devising the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism as well as pointillism. While less famous than his paintings, Seurat's conte crayon drawings have also garnered a great deal of critical appreciation. Seurat's artistic personality combined qualities that are usually supposed to be opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility, on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind. His large-scale work A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884-1886) altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism, and is one of the icons of late 19th-century painting.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Seurat,43
42,Paul Klee,1879 - 1940,"Expressionism,Abstractionism,Surrealism","German,Swiss","Paul Klee (18 December 1879 - 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-born German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included expressionism, cubism, and surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee,188
43,Piet Mondrian,1872 - 1944,Neoplasticism,Dutch,"Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan (after 1906 Piet Mondrian, 7 March 1872 - 1 February 1944), was a Dutch painter and theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements. Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: ""Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise it would have no value for man."" His art, however, always remained rooted in nature.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian,84
44,Joan Miro,1893 - 1983,Surrealism,Spanish,"Joan Miro i Ferra (20 April 1893 - 25 December 1983) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist born in Barcelona. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundacio Joan Miro, was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundacio Pilar i Joan Miro, was established in his adoptive city of Palma de Mallorca in 1981. Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult to classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miro expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an ""assassination of painting"" in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Miro,102
45,Andy Warhol,1928 - 1987,Pop Art,American,"Andy Warhol (born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 - February 22, 1987) was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental films Empire (1964) and Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966-67).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol,181
46,Paul Gauguin,1848 - 1903,"Symbolism,Post-Impressionism",French,"Eugene Henri Paul Gauguin (7 June 1848 - 8 May 1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist. Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gauguin,311
47,Raphael,1483 - 1520,High Renaissance,Italian,"Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (March 28 or April 6, 1483 - April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period. Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37, leaving a large body of work. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael,109
48,Michelangelo,1475 - 1564,High Renaissance,Italian,"Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 - 18 February 1564), known simply as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence, who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. His artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival, the fellow Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci. Several scholars have described Michelangelo as the greatest artist of his age and even as the greatest artist of all time. A number of Michelangelo's works of painting, sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in these fields was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches and reminiscences, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo,49
49,Jackson Pollock,1912 - 1956,Abstract Expressionism,American,"Paul Jackson Pollock (January 28, 1912 - August 11, 1956) was an American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. He was widely noticed for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface (""drip technique""), enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called All-over painting and ""action painting"", since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock,24
